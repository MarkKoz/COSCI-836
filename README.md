### Tasks
Create a custom singly-linked list container.

Create a program which can manage a waiting list of people. The list is to be
sorted primarily in descending order by the monetary bribe given by each
person. Ties are to be resolved chronologically i.e. the person added earlier
wins the tie and is higher on the list.

The program needs to have a menu which allows for the addition of people and
viewing of the list in its current state.
