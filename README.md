### Tasks
Create a custom binary search tree container.

Create a program which can manage a waiting list of people. The list is to be
sorted in descending order by the monetary bribe given by each person.

No duplicate bribe values are to be allowed. In the case of a duplicate, the
node being inserted should not be inserted and a message should be displayed
to the user indicating the occurrence of a duplicate.

The program needs to have a menu which allows for the addition of people and
viewing of the list in its current state.
