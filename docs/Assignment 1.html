<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." History tells us these words were
    inscribed above the entrance to the Data Structures class at ancient Val E
    Community College, where an evil computer science instructor named Genghis
    Khent delighted in tormenting his Data Structures students with apparently
    unsolvable questions on data structures.
</p>
<p>
    Genghis Khent's social life was typical for a computer programmer;
    non-existent. He wanted a date. Since a C++ class can represent anything in
    the real world, he ordered one of his favorite sources of free C++
    programming labor, his CSIT 836 students, to write a class to represent a
    date. Unfortunately for Genghis Khent and his social life, his students
    misunderstood, and wrote a class that represented a calendar date.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately for you, history has repeated itself. A descendant of Genghis
    Khent teaches at Valley College in the CSIT program. You do not know the
    identity of this descendant because the descendant has cleverly changed his
    last name just enough to hide his ancestry, but soon (like now) you will
    have to write the same program.
</p>

<h4>Date Class Member Variables</h4>
<p>
    The following table identifies and describes the
    purpose of each <i>Date</i> class member variable:
</p>

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>month</td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Number corresponding to month of year (e.g., 1-12)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>day</td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Number corresponding to day of month (e.g, 1 to 28-31)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>year</td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>Number corresponding to year</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    All of these class member variables are <i>private</i>. You <u>cannot</u>
    add to or otherwise change these class member variables.
</p>

<h4>Date Class Member Functions</h4>
<p>
    The following table identifies and describes the purpose of each <i>Date</i>
    class member function:
</p>

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Return Value</th>
        <th>Parameters</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>setDate</td>
        <td>void</td>
        <td>3 integers</td>
        <td>
            Assigns the value of each parameter to the month, date and year
            member variables respectively unless the date is not valid (see next
            section)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>printDate</td>
        <td>void</td>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>Outputs the date in the format month/day/year, such as 9/2/2008</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Driver File</h4>
<p>
    The code for the driver file is given below except of the last two
    statements. You need to call <i>setDate</i> and <i>printDate</i>, but you
    are not told exactly how. You can't change the code for the driver file
    except for properly calling <i>setDate</i> and <i></i> in the last two
    statements.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream>

#include "date.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
    Date d1;
    int m, d, y;

    cout << "Enter month, day and year separated by spaces: ";
    cin >> m >> d >> y;

    // call setDate
    // call printDate

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h4>What the Program Does</h4>
<p>
    The user is prompted to enter a month, day and year. If the date is valid,
    then the <i>setDate</i> member function assigns the month, day and year
    inputs to the <i>Date</i> instance. If the date is not valid, then the
    values 9, 2 and 2008 are assigned respectively to the <i>month</i>,
    <i>day</i> and <i>year</i> member variables of the <i>Date</i> instance.
    The <i>printDate</i> function then outputs the <i>Date</i> instance in
    the format month/day/year.
</p>
<p>A date is valid if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The month is between 1 and 12.</li>
    <li>
        The day is between 1 and 31. Yes, I know, for some months the maximum
        number of days may be less than 31 (between 28 and 30), but at LAVC,
        our philosophy is "close enough for government work."
    </li>
    <li>The year is between 1900 and 2008.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sample Runs</h4>
<h4 style="text-decoration: none;">Sample #1 - Valid Date</h4>
<pre>
Enter month, day and year separated by spaces: 9 17 1921
9/17/1921
</pre>

<h4 style="text-decoration: none;">
    Sample #2 - Invalid Date (Default date printed)
</h4>
<pre>
Enter month, day and year separated by spaces: 13 1 2000
9/2/2008
</pre>

<h4>Multiple Files</h4>
<p>
    Use multiple files, separating the class declaration, class implementation
    and driver into separate files, as in Module #2. Thus, your project will
    have three files, <i>date.h</i> (the declaration file for the <i>Date</i>
    class), <i>date.cpp</i> (the implementation file for the <i>Date</i>
    class) and <i>test.cpp</i> (the “driver” file which tests the
    class). All class members (variables and functions) must be <i>private</i>
    unless they need to be <i>public</i>.
</p>

<h4>What You Turn In</h4>
<p>
    Turn in to CANVAS a <i>zip</i> file of <i>date.h</i>, <i>date.cpp</i> and
    <i>test.cpp</i>. I do <u><b>not</b></u> need or want the other files that
    Visual C++ generates—just the code you wrote—as I can just include your
    files in a project I create. You also may include in your <i>zip</i> file
    a <i>pleaformercy.txt</i> file with any comments or message you want to
    give to me.
</p>

<h4>Need Help?</h4>
<p>
    You bet you do! You're a student of Genghis Khent—err, Jeff Kent. Forget
    you heard that.

    textbook referenced in those modules and Chapter 2 of the textbook.

<p>
    You also can post questions (or help others who post questions) in the
    discussion forum on this class' CANVAS website. Remember, you can post a few
    lines of code to provide context to your question, but please don't post all
    your code.
